Answer the following Questions (also found on page 246 of the
textbook), and submit your answers with the rest of your code this
week. Note that we have added additional text in italics below to help
clarify the questions.

1. Problem __10.3__: Suppose you wish to fill a stack with a copy of
another, maintaining the order of elements. Using only Stack
operations (push and pop), describe how this would be done. How many stacks are
necessary (including the source stack and any additional stacks that
you use)? *Note: the original stack and its contents should be
preserved. After completing the steps that you describe, there should
be two identical stacks.*

2. Problem __10.4__: Suppose you wish to reverse the order of elements
of a stack (when you are done, the "reversed elements" should be
located in the original stack). Using only Stacks and Stack
operations (push and pop), describe how this could be done. How many stacks are
necessary (including the source stack and any additional stacks that
you use)?

3. Problem __10.5__: Suppose you wish to move the contents of one
queue into another, preserving the order of the elements. Using only
Queue operations (enqueue and dequeue), describe how this would be done. *Also indicate the
number of queues needed, including the source queue, the destination
queue, and any additional queues that you use.*
